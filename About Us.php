				<h2 class="headline-our">Our Moral Imperative</h2>
				<p>As we collectively face a planet increasingly in distress from climate change, deforestation, pollution, and 
					population growth, Saving Nature is working to create a more sustainable future. 
					<br>
                    Being the source of oxygen for humans to breathe is one of the primary benefits of planting trees.
				   Trees have the amazing capability of absorbing the Carbon dioxide in air and letting out Oxygen 
				   during the process of photosynthesis whereby energy is produced.
                   <br>
                   As the world races to stop climate change, trees are receiving more attention for the role they play 
				   in cooling the climate – and for good reason! Trees absorb and store massive amounts of carbon, and unlike 
				   other carbon removal methods they don’t require expensive technology.

				<p>Planting more trees is the only long-term solution to rising pollution in our cities, climate change, and 
					rapidly dwindling green cover. Most of us are aware of this and wish to help, but for a variety of reasons,
				     our good intentions do not translate into effective actions. You may not have the time, energy, 
					 or space to plant trees, for example. Alternatively, you may be unsure about which plants/trees to cultivate, 
					 how to care for them, and so on. Fortunately, we can assist you in making a positive contribution to
					a greener planet as effortlessly as purchasing online.It not only plants a tree on your behalf, but it also creates jobs and income for
					local communities and rural recipients
