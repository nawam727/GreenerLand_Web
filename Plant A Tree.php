				<h2 class="headline">Importance of Tree Plantation</h2>
				<p>"A tree is the best friend of man on earth." When we use trees respectfully and economically, 
					we have one of the greatest resources on earth. Trees are rightfully called the 'lungs of the earth.' Life on earth would cease to exist in the absence of trees. Trees are responsible for sustaining the environment in several ways.</p>
				<p>Trees release life-supporting oxygen and absorb harmful gases like carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis. They act as sponges by taking in toxic emissions and other pollutants, released into the atmosphere by industries and vehicles. The roots of trees bind the soil together thereby preventing erosion. The blatant and increased rate of deforestation is the primary cause of landslides. In addition to being the bearers of delicious fruits, trees are the natural habitat of several species of animals, birds, and insects. Thus, the destruction of a tree implies the destruction of an entire ecosystem.
				We have inherited this planet with its many resources, from our ancestors. The onus rests on us to protect the earth's fragile ecosystem, so that future generations have a place they can call home. It is indeed ironic that despite being at the top of the food chain Homo Sapiens are intent on destroying the very things that guarantee their survival. However, there is a silver lining. The situation can be remedied by restoring the earth's green cover and taking concrete measures to reduce carbon emissions. Let's all take a vow to go green and save the earth from destruction.</p>
